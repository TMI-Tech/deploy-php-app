# deploy-php-app
Manage configs, file-perms, and snapshots for a LAMP app

## Setup

Depends on https://github.com/caracolazul/make-do for make includes (`mdo-*.mk`).

## Roadmap

Currently, geared towards CiviCRM deployment on Drupal or Wordpress. Would like to isolate platform-specific utils and clarify how they are enabled. Equally supporting both CMS's is already achieved. Using without CiviCRM is un-tested.
